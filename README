Before running the application make sure that you have virtualenv installed.
The script once run should install all of the requirements required and start the server
Application was written using Django.
/applicants, /applications, /college, /backup were done and treated as a separate applications in django.

For database I went with default .sqlite database for the purpose of testing. In future we can  use any datasource we want.
After examining the requirements we went with one to many relationships between college and applicants. Since college can have many applicants
Folder structure
    applicants -> Holds all of the logic for /applicants endpoints
    applications -> Holds all of the logic for /applications endpoints
    backup -> Holds all of the logic for /backup endpoints
    utils -> Was created to hold helpern functions such as error and success messages
